Please star this project if you like it (ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ

This is a fully automatic bot that fish in Albion Online. 
The method of detecting fish is by sound, pyaudio. Probably you need to edit the name of the speaker and the threshold to make this bot work.
Tested on Windows 10. system volume: 30. Game setting: overall volume: 10. sound effect 75. 1920*1080, HUD 100% scale

I can not deal with the speaker instrucment problem for you.
