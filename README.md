Please star this project if you like it (ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ

This is a fully automatic bot that fishes in Albion Online. The functions include cast rod, catch fish, and temperary stop when some other players nearby.
The method of detecting fish catches is by sound, pyaudio lib. Please adjust the code yourself to fit your audio instrument and OS. Probably you need to edit the name of the speaker (Stereo or something probably) and the threshold to make this bot work.

Tested on Windows 10. system volume: 30. Game setting: overall volume: 10. sound effect 75. 1920 * 1080, HUD 100% scale.
Tested on Windows 7.  same configuration.

I can not deal with the speaker instrument problem for you.
